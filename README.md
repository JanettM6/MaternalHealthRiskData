## Abstract
I am working with a dataset aimed at predicting health risks in pregnant patients. The data, gathered from various sources such as hospitals, community clinics, and maternal health care facilities, utilizes an IoT-based risk monitoring system. It includes essential health factors like age, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure, enabling the assessment of the patient's risk level. My goal is to raise awareness about the significant impact of one's health on pregnancy outcomes, aiming to educate and inform women and others about this crucial connection.
